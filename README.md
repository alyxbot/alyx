**Alyx** is a both a Discord Bot and a platform for self-hosted bot enthusiasts. In self-hosted environments,
it is fully pluggable. Plugins can be added both from official sources as well
as third parties, allowing you to customize your own instance of Alyx to your liking and use case.

## Inviting Alyx

Alyx is not quite ready to be a 24/7 available bot that can be invited to your server. Stay tuned!

## Writing Plugins

[ TODO ]

Plugins are not currently able to be installed into instances of Alyx. This feature is in development. The current plan
is to utilize [pf4j](https://github.com/pf4j/pf4j) in order to load JAR files containing the plugins, as well
as having a feature within the bot that can directly download and install these plugins. 

## Why "Alyx?"

The naming comes from the character [Alyx Vance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyx_Vance) 
from the  Î» Half Life 2 video game series, and is one of my favorite video game characters of all time.

## Contributing
Alyx is in its early stages of development.

I fully welcome contributions ranging from bug fixes to new features. I would love for Alyx to evolve into
a community development model as the bot becomes more fully featured.

Have any thoughts? Open an [issue](https://github.com/seputaes/alyx/issues)! I welcome pull requests of any 
shape and size.  If your PR is a bit more complex than a bug fix or minor improvement,
it's best practice to open an issue first so a dialog can be started to flesh the idea out
before time is spent perfecting it.
